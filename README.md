## Dotfiles

My dotfiles - use them and contribute your personal changes/suggestions.

### Installation (export)

Copy all files over the current existing ones (this will effectively overwrite
any current settings).

```
./setup export
```

### Publish settings (import)

Copies a list of files into the current workspace, ready for committing.

```
./setup import
```

### Contribution

Pull requests are welcome, but please state with comments what the settings are
actually doing, unless the setting are somehow self explaining.
